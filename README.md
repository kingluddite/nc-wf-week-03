# When would I use a breadcrumb menu?

Breadcrumbs are particularly useful for websites with deep hierarchies or multi-level navigation structures. Here's a practical use case scenario:

Imagine you're browsing an e-commerce website that sells electronics. You're looking for a specific product, let's say a laptop. You start by browsing through the categories:

1. Home
2. Electronics
3. Computers
4. Laptops

At each step, you can see where you are in the site hierarchy, and you can easily navigate back to the previous levels if needed. This is where breadcrumbs come in handy. In this scenario, the breadcrumb might look like this:

Home > Electronics > Computers > Laptops

Now, if you want to go back to the "Computers" category, you can simply click on "Computers" in the breadcrumb trail, instead of using the browser's back button multiple times or navigating through the main menu again.

Breadcrumbs provide users with a clear path of where they are within the website's structure and allow for easy navigation, especially in complex websites with multiple levels of content. They enhance user experience by providing context and aiding in orientation within the site.
